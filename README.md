# Cybersecurity-code-dynamic-infrastructures-DevOps
One way to implement cybersecurity in dynamic infrastructure using Python is to use the boto3 library to define and manage AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. This allows you to control which users and services have access to your AWS resources.

In this example, we first create an iam client using boto3, which allows us to interact with the AWS IAM service. Then, we define an IAM policy that allows access to the my-secure-bucket S3 bucket only from the IP address 1.2.3.4. We create the IAM policy using the create_policy() method and attach it to an IAM user using the attach_user_policy() method.

This code can be adapted to fit a variety of different security requirements and scenarios. For example, you could use different condition keys in the policy to allow access based on different criteria, such as the time of day or the location of the user. You can find more information about IAM policies and the available condition keys in the AWS documentation.
